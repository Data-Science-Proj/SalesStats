# Summary of Findings from EDA

For my data exploration, I wanted to look at the data in a more general sense to begin with, which is why I started to first look at brands.

## Chart 1 - Bar graph for top 10 brands

I did EDA on brands based on their popularity between Best Buy and Amazon. I wanted to see which brands are the top 10 sellers for both of these companies. I made a bar graph out of this analysis. Logitech ended up being well ahead of the other brands but after some thought, I believe I realize why. Logitech mainly focuses on creating and selling peripherals for more expensive hardware – hardware that other brands like Sony and Microsoft sell. Therefore, since they’re in the peripheral market more so than the actual big product market like Sony and Microsoft, it is obvious to see why their numbers are so high in comparison. We might have to account for this and normalize this data, specifically, if we wish to make any further analysis with it.

## Chart 2 - Chart of Brands and ratings

Afterwards, I wanted to get a picture of how the products of the brands do on costumer rating basis. Therefore, for my 2nd chart I created a table that counted all of the ratings of the products for each brand to paint to a better picture. One interesting thing that I observed in this dataset was that although Logitech has the most ratings, its ratio of “higher-end” ratings (3+) is lower than other several other company’s like Sony for example. From this chart, it is evident that Sony products received overwhelmingly positive ratings which just might paint a different picture in regards to how it may really stand up against Logitech in terms of popularity.  Again, we may have to normalize this data going forward if we want to make further analysis.
